    - get mroe data from daytona in CandC
      - when gettin prices, the price of "TOP" comes up first
    - make sure daytonas are good in each function
    - add promise catches to all functions that use them. This cannot crash. 
    - refactor
    - in CandC, there doesnt need to be 4 fucntions for finding price
