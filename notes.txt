NEED TO DO:
    - deal with "TOP" choice from chrono.
      https://www.chrono24.com/search/index.htm?accessoryTypes=&dosearch=true&query=311.30.42.30.01.005&resultview=list&sortorder=1
      - when gettin prices, the price of "TOP" comes up first
    - add promise catches to all functions that use them. This cannot crash. 
    - change waitForTimeout to waitForSelector
    - crono is a little messed up. Possiby exclude chrono?


    - use 'continue' when the search has no results
      - dont even create a watch object. Waste of space.
    - make sure all object fields are strings
    - remove 'Scrape' and 'AllScrapes' classes
