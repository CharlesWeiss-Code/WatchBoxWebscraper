     - Warn
          - (datejust EX) modles with many sub modles and combinations can return bad data
          - Can't filter bracelet type
          - Can't filter indices type

     

     NEED ATTENTION: 
     - Chrono validChild not working
          - Not getting correct prices for some reason. 

     - Possibly banned from chrono?

     - Re starting doesnt work?
          - moves onto the next reference number?
          - FIXED? added break statements to the end of the catch block. By doing this, the company function will restart-
          and finish and then not continue the previous scrape (because it reaches the break statement).

     - Add check to make sure lowest and highest isnt "" before creating a new watch
